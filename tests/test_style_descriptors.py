"""Regression tests for style-descriptor cleanup (vision_analyzer._clean_descriptors).

Small vision/LLM models sometimes fall into a repetition loop and emit the same
phrase dozens of times. That runaway string used to flow straight into a deck's
`flux_style_prompt`, poisoning the style of every generated card. The cleanup
must collapse such loops to their unique descriptor set.
